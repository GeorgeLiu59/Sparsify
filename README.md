# Sparsify

This repo contains code to sparsify an image based on threshold and/or curve detection. This project performs sparsification on curves in 3 different methods:

- binarized_random.py: Randomly removes a percentage of curves in the image based on the slider value. 
  
- binarized_sorted.py: Removes a percentage of curves from smallest to largest based on area based on the slider value.
  
- binarized_clip.py: Generates 10 random images with the percent of curves removed and picks the image that has the highest CLIP similarity score. You can change how many images are generated by changing the self.complexity parameter in the code file. (Warning: High values of self.complexity could run very slow).
